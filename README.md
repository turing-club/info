# Turing Club Info Resource

In this repository you'll find some of our resources for helping you get into AI and Machine learning quickly, and having fun while doing so! The files labelled with dates is the code used in our workshops and events. Please note that most of this code is tutorial code and not original to this club.

**Here's some helpful links to get you started!**

### Beginner (little to no coding experience required)
- [The main tool we use to make AI - Google Colab!](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [Play around with AI here, get your feet wet](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ai)
- [Here's a great tutorial from Tensorflow and Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras), the two main AI frameworks we use in our workshops. All of the code can be run in your web browser using the Colab notebook links at the top of this page!
- [DeepTesla](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptesla/) - teach an autonomous car to drive by playing around with a few numbers. Check this site out when you're more confident in your coding skills to improve the car's accuracy!
- [An awesome (if a bit concept-heavy) AI textbook](http://artint.info/) written by UBC's [Alan Mackworth](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mack/).
- More resources will be posted on our all-new website, *coming soon!*

**Time to check out some software?**
- [WEKA](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/index.html) is an easy to use app that allows you to get working with big datasets! This is especially useful if you want to get a broad overview of the *mechanisms* of the most popular machine learning techniques. If you're stuck, check out the [WEKA wiki.](http://weka.wikispaces.com/Frequently+Asked+Questions)

- Wanna work on some code beyond our workshops? You'll need an app to write your code in. We recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/) - it's very easy to use for almost any programming language you can think of, and yet it's extremely customizable!

### Intermediate (A bit of coding experience is useful here)

You'll probably want to start installing packages and executing code on your computer at this point to try out some cool AI projects! To do that, you'll have to become familiar with your computer's **shell**. [Here's our intro to shells!](https://github.com/turing-club/info/blob/master/intro-to-shells.md)

Interested in image recognition? Check out [OpenCV](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a powerful computer vision toolbox that's used for a wide variety of corporations and research. It integrates really well with Colab as well, and anyone with a webcam can use it!

If you've got a PC with a good NVidia graphics card, did know that you can use that graphics card for more than just gaming? GPUs are used everywhere to accelerate complex AI computations. Learn how [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone). You can also use Google's GPUs to do computations in Colab! Learn how with [this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/gpu.ipynb).
