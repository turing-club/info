        "Python is a pretty straightforward programming language to learn. If you have no experience with programming languages, then Python is a great place to start because **it's not strict about how you define things.** In other words, it tries to guess what you're doing and makes a lot of assumptions for you, so that you don't have to spell every little detail out. If you do have some experience with programming languages such as Java or C, then you might find Python quite refreshing because you don't have to define every single little detail in the code."
