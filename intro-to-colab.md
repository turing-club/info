# Intro to Colab
Google Colab is the main tool that we use to run AI and machine learning programs in our workshops. It's fast,
requires no installation, comes preinstalled with some AI frameworks, and integrates directly with Google Drive. Formerly an internal tool used by Google's AI researchers,
it now lets anyone run and collaborate on Python code in the cloud!

## Setting up Colab
Firstly, make sure that you have a Google account. If you've used Gmail or Google Docs you should be good
to go! Go to your Google Drive and click on "New" on the left side of the screen. Select "More" from the drop-down menu that
appears. If "Colaboratory" does not already appear in the next drop-down menu, select "+ Connect more apps" at the bottom of
the menu. Search "Colaboratory" in the search box on the screen that appears. 

Once Colaboratory appears as an option on the screen, hover over it and click "+ Connect". Now, when you click the "New" button and select "More", an option called "Colaboratory"
should appear. Click on Colaboratory and wait for it to load (or open a Colaboratory file that you have been provided with, for example at one
of our workshops).

## Using Colab
The resulting interface is known as a *notebook*. Think of this as an interactive notebook in which you can write code and notes,
and attach pictures. The main difference from a typical notebook, though, is that you can run the code that you write, directly
in your web browser. Your notebook is linked to a virtual computer on Google's servers on which you can run your code and
computations!

You'll notice a block with a play icon at the top of the screen. In this block, you can type code and run it by clicking the
play icon. The output of the code will pop up below the block. Note that most code you will type will not produce any output;
that's fine! This area will also show you any errors that may arise from the code.

In the "File" menu, you can save a copy of this notebook in your Google Drive. This is important, especially during workshops.
By default, if you open a Colab notebook then, just like any other Google doc, anyone else who opens that same notebook can
type, run, and edit code. If you're working together with friends on a cool coding project, you might like this feature. However,
it's not useful when you want to have your own copy of the code that you can work with and expand at your pace. So, when you don't
want others to work on your code, save a copy of the notebook you were sent, and work on that notebook instead. By clicking "Runtime"
from the top menu and then selecting "Run all", you can run all of your code at once.

## Troubleshooting
- If you're getting errors, and you're *sure* that you've typed your code correctly, try running each code block from start to finish
by clicking the play button next to each one. It can be easy to  forget to click one of these blocks, which could contain the code
needed to finish running your program!
- For best results, make sure that you have a reliable internet connection and a modern browser (Chrome works best).
